RT-Extension-MandatoryFields - Enforce users to fill standard fields
when creating a ticket



This RT Extension enforces users to fill standard fields defined in RT
site configuration file when creating a ticket via the web interface.

Installation
============

To install this extension, run the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

Configuration
=============

To make this extension active register it to in RT site configuration
file located in RT_HOME/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm where RT_HOME is the path
to your RT installation.

    Set(@Plugins,qw(RT::Extension::MandatoryFields));

To enforce users to fill the standard fields add them to
%MandatoryFields:

    Set(%MandatoryFields, (
        'Requestors' => 'true',
        'Cc' => 'true',
        'AdminCc' => 'true',
        'Subject' => 'true',
        'Content' => 'true',
        'Attach' => 'true',
        'Status' => 'true',
        'Owner' => 'true'
    ));

Mark a mandatory field with 'true', otherwise 'false'.

Note: There are more than one way to create a new ticket. The default
way is 'Create', but there are 'QuickCreate' on the home page and
'SelfService' for unpreviledged users, too. This extension handles them
all. If a formular doesn't include one of the fields marked as mandatory
(set to 'true' in the configuration) it will be ignored. Don't get
confused, if you set a mandatory field that won't show up on the web
interface. The table below gives you a short summarize which formular
supports which mandatory field.

  Field        Mandatory Per Default   Create     QuickCreate    SelfService
  ------------ ----------------------- ---------- -------------- --------------
  Requestors   no                      included   included       included
  Cc           no                      included   not included   included
  AdminCc      no                      included   not included   not included
  Subject      no                      included   included       included
  Content      no                      included   included       included
  Attach       no                      included   not included   included
  Status       no                      included   not included   not included
  Owner        no                      included   included       not included

After all your new configuration will take effect after restarting your
RT environment:

    rm -rf RT_HOME/var/mason_data/obj/* && service apache2 restart

This is an example for deleting the mason cache and restarting the
Apache HTTP web server on a Debian based operating system.
